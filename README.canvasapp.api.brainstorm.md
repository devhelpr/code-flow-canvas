# CanvasApp API brainstorm

## How to programmatically create a node with custom markup

- canvasApp.createRect
- position, width, height, className
- markup

resulting node shoud have a wrapper div with className properties and a child div with the markup

- it should have invisible resize handlers
- it should have visible thumbs (currently centered on the left and right sides)
- background should be controlled by the className property
