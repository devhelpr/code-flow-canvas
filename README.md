# VpsWeb

Visual programming system build with web components using DOM as a canvas mixing svg and html using RAW DOM API.

## TODO's

- use custom properties from within components
- basis interaction state machine
- add svg test component
- connect two nodes with a line

- "signals"
- update state of components with children

- how can this be made declarative using the layout-compiler and expression-compiler?

- can this be transformed to a native app?
