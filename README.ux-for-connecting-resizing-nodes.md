# UX for resizing nodes

- connectors should be hidden
- when dragging a connection to a node, when near a node, show the node's connectors

- reszing should always be possible, resizes handlers should be invisible but a hint should
  be shown when hovering over the node with the mouse
  ... how to handle this on a touch device?


- some things to take in consideration:

	- nodes can be resized in any direction
	- nodes can have different shapes.. but the resizing should be the same for all nodes
      using a rectangle as a base
	- nodes can have different connectors on different sides and locations
